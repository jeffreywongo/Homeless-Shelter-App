# Homeless-Shelter-App
2340 Group Project

The goal of this project was to create an app to display homeless shelters in Atlanta.
The app does this by making calls to a REST server for user and shelter information.

To run the app, open it in android studio and run it on an emulator or using a physical device.
To Register, all you have to do is make sure:
  - your email is in a valid <username>@<email>.com
  - your password matches
  - you select the "user" option (idk if admin works)
  - click register TWICE (the first attempt fails. This is a bug)

We were mainly focused on making sure we completed on time, so best practices were secondary to that.
Looking back, there are some things I would have done differently but I don't really have an incentive to make any changes.
Instead, I left various comments detailing what I would have done.
These comments will be in the format:
